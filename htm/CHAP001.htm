<h2><a name="SECT001">1.1 Overview</a></h2>
<p><p>
This manual describes the <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">Cubefree</font>  package,
a <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> 4 package for constructing groups of cubefree order; i.e., groups
whose order is not divisible by any third power of a prime.
<p>
The groups of squarefree order are known for a long time: Hoelder
<a href="biblio.htm#Hol93"><cite>Hol93</cite></a> investigated them at the end of the 19th century. Taunt
<a href="biblio.htm#Tau55"><cite>Tau55</cite></a> has considered solvable groups of cubefree order, since he
examined solvable groups with abelian Sylow subgroups. Cubefree groups in
general are investigated firstly in <a href="biblio.htm#Di05"><cite>Di05</cite></a>, <a href="biblio.htm#DiEi05"><cite>DiEi05</cite></a>, and <a href="biblio.htm#DiEi05add"><cite>DiEi05add</cite></a>, and this
package contains the implementation of the algorithms described
there.
<p>
Some general approaches to construct groups of an arbitrarily given order are
described in <a href="biblio.htm#BeEia"><cite>BeEia</cite></a>, <a href="biblio.htm#BeEib"><cite>BeEib</cite></a>, and <a href="biblio.htm#BeEiO"><cite>BeEiO</cite></a>.
<p>
The main function of this package is a method to construct 
all groups of a given cubefree order up to isomorphism. The algorithm behind this function is
described completely in <a href="biblio.htm#Di05"><cite>Di05</cite></a> and <a href="biblio.htm#DiEi05"><cite>DiEi05</cite></a>. It is a refinement of
the methods of the <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GrpConst</font> package which are described in <a href="biblio.htm#GrpConst"><cite>GrpConst</cite></a>.
<p>
This main function needs a method to construct up to conjugacy the solvable
cubefree subgroups of GL(2,<i>p</i>) coprime to <i>p</i>. We split this construction
into the construction of reducible and irreducible subgroups of GL(2,<i>p</i>). To determine the
irreducible subgroups we use the method described in <a href="biblio.htm#FlOB05"><cite>FlOB05</cite></a> for which this package
also contains an implementation. Alternatively, the <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">IrredSol</font> package
<a href="biblio.htm#Irredsol"><cite>Irredsol</cite></a> could be used for primes <i>p</i> &#8804; 251.
<p>
The algorithm of <a href="biblio.htm#FlOB05"><cite>FlOB05</cite></a> requires a method to rewrite a matrix
representation. We use and implement the method of <a href="biblio.htm#GlHo97"><cite>GlHo97</cite></a> for this purpose.
<p>
One can modify the construction algorithm for cubefree groups to a very
efficient algorithm to construct groups of squarefree order. This is already
done in the  <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">SmallGroups</font> library. Thus for the construction of groups of squarefree order it is more practical to
use <code>AllSmallGroups</code> of the <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">SmallGroups</font> library. 
<p>
A more detailed description of the implemented methods can be found in Chapter 2.
<p>
Chapter <a href="CHAP003.htm">Installing and Loading the Cubefree Package</a> explains
how to install and load the <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">Cubefree</font> package.

<h2><a name="SECT002">1.2 Theoretical background</a></h2>
<p><p>
In this section we give a brief survey about the main algorithm which is used
to construct groups of cubefree order: the Frattini extension method. For a by
far more detailed description
we refer to the above references; e.g. see the online version of <a href="biblio.htm#Di05"><cite>Di05</cite></a>.
<p>
Let <i>G</i> be a finite group. The Frattini subgroup &#934;(<i>G</i>) is defined to be
the intersection of all maximal subgroups of <i>G</i>. We say a group <i>H</i> is a
Frattini extension by <i>G</i> if the Frattini factor <i>H</i>/&#934;(<i>H</i>) is isomorphic to
<i>G</i>. The Frattini factor of <i>H</i> is Frattini-free; i.e. it has a trivial
Frattini subgroup. It is known that every prime divisor of &#124;<i>H</i>&#124; is also a divisor of
&#124;<i>H</i>/&#934;(<i>H</i>)&#124;. Thus the Frattini subgroup of a cubefree group has to be
squarefree and, as it is nilpotent, it is a direct product of cyclic groups of
prime order.
<p>
Hence in order to construct all groups of a given cubefree order <i>n</i>, say, one can,
firstly, construct all Frattini-free groups of suitable orders and, secondly, compute
all corresponding Frattini extensions of order <i>n</i>. A first fundamental result
is that  a group of cubefree order is either a solvable Frattini
extension or a direct product of a PSL(2,<i>r</i>), <i>r</i> &gt; 3 a prime, with a solvable
Frattini extension. In particular, the simple groups of cubefree
order are the groups PSL(2,<i>r</i>) with <i>r</i> &gt; 3 a prime such that <i>r</i>&#177;1 is cubefree. As a nilpotent group is the direct product of its Sylow subgroups, it
is straightforward to compute all nilpotent groups of a given cubefree order.
<p>
Another important result is
that for a cubefree solvable Frattini-free group there is exactly one isomorphism
type of suitable Frattini extensions, which restricts the construction of
cubefree groups to the
determination of cubefree solvable
Frattini-free groups.  This uniqueness of Frattini extensions is the
main reason why the Frattini extension method works so efficiently in the
cubefree case. 
<p>
In other words, there is a one-to-one correspondence between
the solvable cubefree groups of order <i>n</i> and <em>some</em>Frattini-free groups of order
dividing <i>n</i>. This allows to count the number of isomorphism types of cubefree groups of a given
order without
constructing Frattini extensions.
<p>
In the remaining part of this section we consider the construction of the
solvable Frattini-free groups of a given cubefree order up to
isomorphism. Such a group is a split extension over its socle; i.e. over the
product of its minimal normal subgroups. Let <i>F</i> be a solvable Frattini-free
group of cubefree order with socle <i>S</i>. Then <i>S</i> is a (cubefree) direct product of cyclic
groups of prime order and <i>F</i> can be written as <i>F</i>=<i>K</i>\ltimes <i>S</i>
where <i>K</i> &#8804; Aut(<i>S</i>) is determined up to conjugacy. In particular, <i>K</i> is a subdirect product of certain
cubefree subgroups of groups of the type GL(2,<i>p</i>) or
<i>C</i><sub><i>p</i>&#8722;1</sub>. Hence in order to determine all possible subgroups <i>K</i> one can
determine all possible projections from such a subgroup into the direct factors
of the types GL(2,<i>p</i>) and <i>C</i><sub><i>p</i>&#8722;1</sub>, and then form all subdirect
products having these projections. The construction of these subdirect
products is one of the most time-consuming parts in the Frattini extension
method for cubefree groups.
