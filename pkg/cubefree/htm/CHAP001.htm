This manual describes the <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">Cubefree</font>  package,
a <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> package for constructing groups of cubefree order; that is, groups
whose order is not divisible by any third power of a prime.
<p>
The groups of squarefree order are known for a long time, since Hoelder
<a href="biblio.htm#Hol93"><cite>Hol93</cite></a> investigated them at the end of the 19th century. Taunt
<a href="biblio.htm#Tau55"><cite>Tau55</cite></a> has considered solvable groups of cubefree order, since he
examined solvable groups with abelian Sylow subgroups. Cubefree groups in
general are investigated firstly in <a href="biblio.htm#Di05"><cite>Di05</cite></a> and <a href="biblio.htm#DiEi05"><cite>DiEi05</cite></a>, and this
package contains the implementation of the algorithms described
there.
<p>
Some general approaches to construct groups of an arbitrarily given order are
described in <a href="biblio.htm#BeEia"><cite>BeEia</cite></a>, <a href="biblio.htm#BeEib"><cite>BeEib</cite></a>, and <a href="biblio.htm#BeEiO"><cite>BeEiO</cite></a>.
<p>
The main function of this package is a method to construct up to isomorphism
all groups of a given cubefree order. The algorithm behind this function is
described completely in <a href="biblio.htm#Di05"><cite>Di05</cite></a> and <a href="biblio.htm#DiEi05"><cite>DiEi05</cite></a>. It is a refinement of
the methods of the <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GrpConst</font> package which are described in <a href="biblio.htm#GrpConst"><cite>GrpConst</cite></a>.
<p>
This main function needs a method to construct up to conjugacy the solvable
cubefree subgroups of GL(2,<i>p</i>) coprime to <i>p</i>. These subgroups are
constructed using the irreducible subgroups of GL(2,<i>p</i>). To determine these
irreducible subgroups we use the method described in <a href="biblio.htm#FlOB05"><cite>FlOB05</cite></a> for which this package
also contains an implementation. Alternatively, the <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">Irredsol</font> package
<a href="biblio.htm#Irredsol"><cite>Irredsol</cite></a> could be used for <i>p</i> <= 251.
<p>
The algorithm of <a href="biblio.htm#FlOB05"><cite>FlOB05</cite></a> requires a method to rewrite a
representation. We use and implement the method of <a href="biblio.htm#GlHo97"><cite>GlHo97</cite></a> for this purpose.
<p>
For the construction of groups of squarefree order it is more practical to
use the efficient function <var>AllSmallGroups</var> of the <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GrpConst</font> package.
<p>
A more detailed describtion of the implemented methods can be found in Chapter 2.
<p>
Chapter <a href="CHAP003.htm">Installing and Loading the Cubefree Package</a> explains
how to install and load the <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">Cubefree</font> package.
