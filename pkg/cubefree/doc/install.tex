The installation of the {\Cubefree} package follows standard {\GAP} rules.
So the standard method is to unpack the package into the `pkg'
directory  of your {\GAP} distribution.  This will create an `cubefree'
subdirectory.

For other non-standard options please see Chapter~"ref:Installing a
GAP Package" in the {\GAP} Reference Manual.

%To create the documentation, go into the `doc' directory and type
%`make_doc'.

To use the {\Cubefree} Package you have to request it explicitly. This  is
done by calling `LoadPackage' like this:

\beginexample
gap> LoadPackage("Cubefree");
Loading Cubefree 1.0 ...

The `LoadPackage' command is described in Section~"ref:LoadPackage"
in the {\GAP} Reference Manual.
