The installation of the {\Cubefree} package follows standard {\GAP} rules, see
also 
Chapter~"ref:Installing a GAP Package" in the {\GAP} reference manual.
So the standard method is to unpack the package into the `pkg'
directory  of your {\GAP} distribution.  This will create an `cubefree'
subdirectory.

To use the {\Cubefree} Package you have to request it explicitly. This  is
done by calling `LoadPackage' like this:

\beginexample
gap> LoadPackage("cubefree");
true
gap>
\endexample
